# ECG-Biometrics

This repository provides a comprehensive and easy-to-use set of experiments on **ECG signal processing for biometric recognition**, including both **identification** and **verification** tasks.

Our goal is to build a centralized and reproducible framework covering multiple stages of ECG-based biometric systems ‚Äî from preprocessing to feature extraction, and model training to evaluation ‚Äî using **well-known public datasets** and **state-of-the-art algorithms**.

We aim to continuously update this repository with:
- Popular **ECG biometric datasets** (e.g., HeartPrint, ECG-ID, PhysioNet PTB, etc.)
- Benchmark **preprocessing pipelines** and **normalization techniques**
- Deep learning and traditional **feature extraction** methods
- **Identification** and **verification** models (e.g., CNNs, Siamese Networks, Contrastive Learning, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics and reproducibility scripts

## üîç Motivation
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are unique to individuals and difficult to spoof, making them an excellent modality for biometric recognition. However, challenges such as **temporal variability**, **emotional and physiological state dependency**, and **signal noise** require robust signal processing and learning algorithms.

This repository serves researchers and developers who want:
- Ready-to-run experiments on various ECG biometric datasets
- Benchmark comparisons between different methods
- A modular base to develop and test novel approaches

## üöß Repository Structure (Work in Progress)




## üìÖ Coming Soon
- Baseline identification and verification pipelines
- Pretrained models and checkpoints
- Visualization tools (e.g., heartbeat template comparison, embedding space)
